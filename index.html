        As a tech geek, I have worked fervently remotely to study and resolve a
        variety of technological issues with different people. I am a
        forward-thinking, goal-oriented individual with extensive digital skills
        to adapt and thrive in a world that is changing quickly. Always focused
        on finishing the task at hand in the amount of time allotted during the
        project's planning. My motivation is versatility and accurate
        multitasking.
